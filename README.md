# More Swift Collections

This package provides collection data structures and algorithms:

- `StableDictionary`: A drop-in replacement for Swift's `Dictionary` that preserves the indicies of its key/value pairs on mutation.
- `StableSet`: A drop-in replacement for Swift's `Set` that preserves the indicies of its elements on mutation.
